# Notes

## Features

Syntax highlighting for notes, with simple TODO lists. Also allows you to cross-link (cmd-click) between notes.

Syntax highlighting based on [Sublime Text Notes](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Notes) by tbh1.

## Snippets & Commands

A `newday` snippet includes the current date and a set of organizing section headings:

```
[2019-02-02]
Notes:
Ideas:
TODO:
Activity Log:
```

To add a new "TODO" item checkbox, use the `cmd+L` shortcut:

```
[ ] Pick up daughter after school
```

When the cursor is on a line with a TODO checkbox, subsequent `cmd+L` directives will cycle through `[âˆš]` (done) and `[x]` (won't do).

## Cross-linking Notes

If you mention another `*.notes` file, it will be underlined and become a hyperlink: `work.notes`. To follow the link, use the vscode `cmd+click` standard feature. References to notes can be absolute or relative; if relative, they are relative to the current document.

If the notes file you'd like to link to contains spaces, you can use "double quotes" to indicate the spaces should be included in the hyperlink. You can also use tilde (`~`) to mean your home directory, e.g. `~Notes/journal.notes`.

## Configuration

You may want to configure some of the text colors, for instance in your vscode settings file (`Cmd+,` on Mac OS X), you can add scopes like so:

```
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
        {
            "scope": "keyword.operator.notes",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#92b630"
            }
        },
        {
            "scope": "variable.language.notes",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#92b630",
                "fontStyle": "italic"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Some of the scopes you can configure are as follows:

```
keyword.operator.notes
keyword.other.notes
variable.language.notes
entity.name.tag.notes
comment.notes
string.quoted.single.notes
string.quoted.double.notes
invalid.deprecated.notes
```

Other scopes are language-specific.
